# Old-PSX-modchip-dumps
Just dumping out a collection of removed modchips for archiving purposes, just keen to see if any vary. 
File name includes the PIC chip they were found on as oppose to being indicative of what they'll work on.
Most were saved as binary and renamed to HEX extension but won't make a difference when loaded into XGpro
